  <description>kSNP3 is a program that identifies the pan-genome SNPs in a set of genome sequences, and estimates phylogenetic trees based upon those SNPs</description>

    mkdir TestRun1;
    kSNP3 -in $in_list -outdir TestRun1 -k 13 -CPU 4 >> $results_file 2>> $output_file

<!--
	command tag needs at least to pipe stderr because kSNP defaults write there like: 2>> someoutput_file. Use $ infront of filename to have it the <outputs> tag for galaxy to monitor the job live in the browser.

  <help>
    kSNP3 is provided as both a Linux package for 64-bit CPUs and as a Mac OS X package. The packages contain the kSNP3 program and this documentation. In addition there are two example input data sets that are used as the basis for the discussion of the output files in Section III. Those data sets must be downloaded separately.
