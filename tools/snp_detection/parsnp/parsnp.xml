<tool id="parsnp" name="parsnp - snp detection" version="3.0.0">
  <description>Parsnp is a command-line-tool for efficient microbial core genome alignment and SNP detection. Parsnp was designed to work in tandem with Gingr, a flexible platform for visualizing genome alignments and phylogenetic trees; both Parsnp and Gingr form part of the Harvest suite :

Parsnp is primarily distributed as a binary for Linux or OS X (see Parsnp link above ). However, the source and build scripts are provided for incompatible platforms or for development purposes.</description>

  <help>
    kSNP3 is provided as both a Linux package for 64-bit CPUs and as a Mac OS X package. The packages contain the kSNP3 program and this documentation. In addition there are two example input data sets that are used as the basis for the discussion of the output files in Section III. Those data sets must be downloaded separately.
